Aks cluster setup


I made few tweaks.

 

Please refer to this - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kubernetes/index.htm

 

Then I realised you should properly update this document to explain about the following aspects

 

Separation of system and application specific node pools
Details on min, max, replicasets etc and then about config settings on how long to wait before increasing between mix and max counts depending on load
Details on Load Balancer, Auto scaler
Explain about resource limits
 

You also owe me the Kubernetes dashboard setup for monitoring and administration.
